# VRChat-Musicbee-Chatbox

Forked from [this project](https://github.com/o0F-0oF/VRChat-Spotify-Chatbox), I wanted to modify it to show what I'm currently listening to on MusicBee.

## I plan on making this more user-configurable by giving it a GUI, and allowing for more things to be sent to the chatbox, as well as some other QOL fixes.
